If text is split improperly, you might end up with chunks that separate semantically related information, making it difficult to retrieve the complete context needed to answer questions correctly.\n",

    "1. **Chunk Size**: This determines the size of each chunk. The size can be measured in different ways, commonly by character count or token count. We define this with the `chunk_size` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Chunk Overlap**: This creates an overlap between adjacent chunks, like a sliding window. Having overlapping text ensures that context isn't lost at the boundaries between chunks. For example, if important information spans the end of one chunk and the beginning of another, the overlap ensures it's captured in both chunks. We define this with the `chunk_overlap` parameter.\n",

    "LangChain text splitters provide two main methods:\n",

    "- `split_documents()`: Takes a list of document objects and splits them while preserving metadata\n",
