      "I study it closely as a me mber of the  Federal Open Market Committee  (FOMC) .  From \n",
      "the perspective of the labor market, many workers have ties to housing- related  sectors , \n",
      "including construction, real estate, and the mortgage finance industry.  And because \n",
      "housing is a large fraction of household wealth , the housing market influences  consumer \n",
