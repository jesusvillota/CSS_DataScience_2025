Any more questions? Okay.  \\nSo this endows linear regression with a probabilistic interpretation. Iâm actually going to \\nuse this probabil â use this, sort of, probabilistic interpretation in order to derive our next \\nlearning algorithm, which will be our first classification algorithm. Okay? So youâll recall \\nthat I said that regression problems are where the variable Y that youâre trying to predict \\nis continuous values. Now Iâm actually gonna talk about our first classification problem, \\nwhere the value Y youâre trying to predict will be discreet value. You can take on only a \\nsmall number of discrete values and in this case Iâll talk about binding classification \\nwhere Y takes on only two values, right? So you come up with classification problems if \\nyouâre trying to do, say, a medical diagnosis and try to decide based on some features that \\nthe patient has a disease or does not have a disease. Or if in the housing example, maybe \\nyouâre trying to decide will this house sell in the next six months or not and the answer is \\neither yes or no.
